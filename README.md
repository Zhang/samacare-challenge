Please find my attempt at the requirements for this coding challenge.

This project is built as React component built with JSS (CSS in JS) and Express/MongoDB.

To execute this code run:

npm i
npm run pack
npm start

And navigate to 127.0.0.1:3000

I'm most proud of my highly organized package structure, with minimal dependencies, and logical easy to follow components.

I made a number of tradeoffs, and burned through too much time trying to using HTML5 canvas features. I also was surprised
how long it took me to implement API features (I was about 15 minutes from finishing persistent markups of the images before calling it quits).

I hope that this package displays a strong start on what was asked, albeit incomplete. With another 24 hours I'm confident I would be able to finish a much more formidable package, and I'm extremely thankful for the learning experience.

Thank you for taking the time to review my code.
